# EC500 Twitter API Project

This program will take a twitter handle, find the media files in the last 200 tweets and download them. It then stitches them together
using ffmpeg into a video. Finally, you will receive command line outputs about what the video is generally about.

### Prerequisites
  Make sure all the proper packages are downloaded including:
  ```
  pip
  ```
  ```
  wget
  ```
  ```
  tweepy
  google-cloud
  ffmpeg
  ```
